# Birdcall-Recognition-based-on-Bird-Vocalizations-using-DCNN

To classify various bird calls, used a feature fusion of deep features extracted using multiple pretrained deep neural networks with ensemble models in pipeline manner.
Cornell Birdcall Challenge 2020 dataset, which is available on Kaggle used for training and testing purpose.
Preprocessing steps such as noise removal and other background calls from audio performed, then statistical and visual features fed to DCNN models.
# Technology/Libraries Used: Python, Google Colab, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Keras, Tensorflow, Matplotlib, Librosa, IPython, Scipy, DCNN Models.
